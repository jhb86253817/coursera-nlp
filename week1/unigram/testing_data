But in all its 175 years , not a single Negro student has entered its classrooms . 
Last week Federal District Judge William A. Bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a `` qualified '' Negro boy and girl . 
Their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education , from kindergarten through graduate school , in Georgia -- and in Alabama , Mississippi and South Carolina as well . 
For 18 months , Hamilton Holmes , 19 , and Charlayne Hunter , 18 , had tried to get into the university . 
They graduated together from Atlanta's Turner High School , where Valedictorian Holmes was first in the class and Charlayne third . 
The university rejected them on a variety of pretexts , but was careful never to mention the color of their skins . 
Holmes went to Atlanta's Morehouse ( Negro ) College , where he is a B student and star halfback . 
Charlayne studied journalism at Detroit's Wayne State University . 
Last fall , after they took their hopes for entering Georgia to court , Judge Bootle ordered them to apply again . 
Charlayne was `` tentatively '' admitted for next fall , after state investigators questioned her white roommate at Wayne State . 
But Holmes was rejected again `` on the basis of his record and interview '' . 
The evidence in court was testimony about the interview , which for Holmes lasted an hour , although at least one white student at Georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation . 
Holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution , or a `` beatnik parlor or teahouse '' . 
No , said he , but officials still called him `` evasive '' . 
They also said he lied in saying that he had never been `` arrested '' . 
Their reason : Holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine , had his license suspended . 
Negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white students , found that many were hardly interviewed at all -- and few had academic records as good as Hamilton Holmes . 
The real reason for his rejection , they argued , is the fact that Georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school . 
Judge Bootle's decision : `` The two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color '' . 
The state will appeal -- but few think it will actually try to close the university . 
`` Surprised and pleased '' , Students Holmes and Hunter may enter the University of Georgia this week . 
Catch for Chicago 
When the University of Chicago's Chancellor Lawrence A. Kimpton submitted his resignation last March , a mighty talent hunt gripped the Midway . 
Out went letters to 60,000 old grads , asking for suggestions . 
Such academic statesmen as James B. Conant were consulted . 
Two committees pondered 375 possible Kimpton successors , including Adlai Stevenson , Richard Nixon , and Harvard's Dean McGeorge Bundy . 
The debate led to a decision that Chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator , but rather , as Trustee Chairman Glen A. Lloyd put it , `` a top scholar in his own right '' -- a bright light to lure other top scholars to Chicago . 
Last week Chicago happily found its top scholar in Caltech's acting dean of the faculty : dynamic Geneticist George Wells Beadle , 57 , who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry ( Time , Cover , July 14 , 1958 ) . 
It fell to Chancellor Kimpton , now a Standard Oil ( Indiana ) executive , to spend his nine-year reign tidying up Chicago after the 21-year typhoon of Idealist Robert Maynard Hutchins . 
He threw out some of Hutchins' more wildly experimental courses , raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2,100 , nearly doubled endowment to $139.3 million . 
But though Kimpton put Chicago in what he felt was working order , some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady Hutchins era . 
At Caltech , Geneticist Beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the school's famous biology division since 1946 . 
But he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot , recruit and excite able researchers , and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speech-making . 
Beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters ; ; 
he avidly reads the Wall Street Journal , and took delight in driving a $250 model A Ford for 22 years , then selling it for $300 . 
A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . 
But a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . 
The man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . 
By force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . 
This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; 
and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . 
Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; ; 
they were determined by the points at which Leopold's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking . 
The population of the Congo is 13.5 million , divided into at least seven major `` culture clusters '' and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects . 
The religions of the people include Christianity , Mohammedanism , paganism , ancestor worship and animism . 
The climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate . 
The hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars . 
To make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case ; ; 
it has been made far more difficult by what the Belgians have done , or failed to do , in the Congo since 1885 . 
At first the Belgian royal family administered the Congo as its own private property . 
But by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience . 
The Belgian government itself took over administration , commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism . 
One definition of paternalism is `` The principle or practice , on the part of a government , of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children '' . 
The honor of the Belgians in this matter is not to be questioned -- only their judgment . 
Ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time -- but when the colony received independence in 1960 the Congolese child , if one imagines him to have been born in 1908 , was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant . 
The Belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the Congo , which is rich in copper , tin , cobalt , manganese , zinc , and uranium , and cotton and palm oil . 
The colony was administered from Brussels , with neither the Congolese nor the resident Belgians having any vote . 
The beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the Belgian government itself held stock . 
In Inside Africa , John Gunther describes one of these , the Societe Generale , as `` the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if , let us say , the House of Morgan , Anaconda Copper , the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York , the Pennsylvania Railroad , and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together , with the United States government as a heavy partner '' . 
Had they been truly ruthless , the Belgians might have exploited the Congolese without compassion . 
But they were not . 
They provided a social security system which covered all their African employes ; ; 
their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent ; ; 
they put much effort into public housing . 
They also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the Congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food . 
But instead of delivering the ration -- either in actual commodities or in cash -- at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month , the Belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often . 
Would not the children , if they received all their food on the first day of the month , eat it up immediately , and later go hungry ? ? 
The Belgians also placed great emphasis on education . 
During the 1950s there were as many as 25,000 schools in the Congo . 
But almost all the schools were primary . 
The average Congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of `` la chatte '' and `` le chien '' and write his name . 
Some schools were technical -- the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land , and trained many . 
But they did not believe in widespread secondary education , much less in college . 
It was their conviction that the people should be `` brought up together '' , a grade at a time , until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history , economics and political science . 
Indeed , the Belgians discouraged higher education , fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest . 
When the Congo received its independence in 1960 there were , among its 13.5 million people , exactly 14 university graduates . 
Why did the Belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it ? ? 
In one large oversimplification , it might be said that the Belgians felt , far too late , the gale of nationalism sweeping Africa . 
They lacked time to prepare the Congo , as the British and French had prepared their colonies . 
The Congolese were clamoring for their independence , even though most were unsure what it meant ; ; 
and in Brussels , street crowds shouted , `` Pas une goutte de sang ! ! 
'' ( Not one drop of blood ! ! 
) . 
The Belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue ; ; 
rather than teach where teaching was not wanted , they would wash their hands of the mess . 
It is hard to blame them for this . 
Yet there were other motivations and actions which the Belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless . 
As the time for independence approached there were in the Congo no fewer than 120 political parties , or approximately eight for each university graduate . 
There were four principal ones . 
First , there were those Congolese ( among them Joseph Kasavubu ) who favored splitting the country into small independent states , Balkanizing it . 
Second , there were those ( Moise Tshombe ) who favored near-Balkanization , a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority , with much power residing in the states . 
Third , there were those ( notably Patrice Lumumba ) who favored a unified Congo with a very strong central government . 
And fourth , there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew up . 
However , the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting . 
A final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the Congo , immediately after independence , was the provincial structure that had been established by the Belgians for convenience in administration . 
They had divided the Congo into six provinces -- Leopoldville , Kasai , Kivu , Katanga , Equator and Eastern -- unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings . 
Thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other , and to them independence meant an opportunity for war . 
The Belgian Congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable Western-style form of government : there were to be a president and a premier , and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces . 
Well-wishers around the world hoped that the Congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations . 
If internal frictions arose , they could be handled by the 25,000-man Congolese army , the Force Publique , which had been trained and was still officered by white Belgians . 
The president , Joseph Kasavubu , seemed an able administrator and the premier , Patrice Lumumba , a reasonable man . 
Twenty-four hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other . 
Presently the well-armed members of the Force Publique -- many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes , erupted in mutiny , rioting , raping and looting . 
Terror engulfed the thousands of Belgian civilians who had remained in the country . 
The Belgian government decided to act , and on July 10 dispatched paratroops to the Congo . 
On July 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of Katanga , Moise Tshombe , announced that his province had seceded from the country . 
Confusion became chaos ; ; 
each succeeding day brought new acts of violence . 
Lumumba and Kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the Belgians , and appealed to the United Nations to send troops to oust them . 
On July 14 the Security Council -- with France and Great Britain abstaining -- voted the resolution which drew the U.N. into the Congo . 
Vague in wording , it called for withdrawal of Belgian troops and authorized the Secretary-General `` to take the necessary steps to provide the ( Congolese ) Government with such military assistance as may be necessary , until , through the efforts of the Congolese Government with the technical assistance of the United Nations , the national security forces may be able , in the opinion of the Government , to meet fully their tasks . 
'' 
Secretary-General Hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the U.N. troops sent into the Congo were to come from African , or at least nonwhite , nations -- certainly not from the U.S. , Russia , Great Britain or France . 
He quickly called on Ghana , Tunisia , Morocco , Guinea and Mali , which dispatched troops within hours . 
Ultimately the U.N. army in the Congo reached a top strength of 19,000 , including about 5,000 from India and a few soldiers from Eire and Sweden , who were the only whites . 
It took the U.N. three months to bring a modest form of order to the Congo . 
The Belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed U.N. efforts . 
The wildly erratic nature of Patrice Lumumba caused constant problems -- he frequently announced that he wanted the U.N. to get out of the Congo along with the Belgians , and appealed to Russia for help . 
( However , there is little evidence that the late Lumumba was a Communist . 
Before appealing to the U.N. or to Russia , he first appealed to the U.S. for military help , and was rejected . 
) Lumumba further complicated the U.N.'s mission by initiating small `` wars '' with the secessionist province of Katanga and with South Kasai which , under Albert Kalonji , wanted to secede as well . 
Meanwhile Russia took every opportunity to meddle in the Congo , sending Lumumba equipment for his `` wars '' , dispatching `` technicians '' and even threatening , on occasion , to intervene openly . 
But by the end of the three-month period , in October 1960 , something approaching calm settled on the Congo . 
President Kasavubu became exasperated with Lumumba and fired him . 
Lumumba fired Kasavubu . 
Control of the government -- such control as there was and such government as there was -- passed into the hands of Joseph Mobutu , chief of staff of the Congolese army . 
Mobutu promptly flung out the Russians , who have not since played any significant part on the local scene , although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at U.N. headquarters in New York . 
The Belgians -- at least officially -- departed from the Congo as well , withdrawing all of their uniformed troops . 
But they left behind them large numbers of officers , variously called `` volunteers '' or `` mercenaries '' , who now staff the army of Moise Tshombe in Katanga , the seceded province which , according to Tshombe , holds 65% of the mineral wealth of the entire country . 
From October 1960 to February 1961 , the U.N. forces in the Congo took little action . 
There was no directive for it -- the Security Council's resolution had not mentioned political matters , and in any case the United Nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation , whether to unify it , federalize it or Balkanize it . 
During the five-month lull , civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the Congo . 
In February the murder of Patrice Lumumba , who had been kidnaped into Katanga and executed on order of Tshombe , again stirred the U.N. to action . 
On Feb. 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of `` all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the Congo , including the use of force , if necessary , in the last resort '' . 
Although the resolution might have been far more specific , it was considerably tougher than the earlier one . 
It also urged that the U.N. eject , and prevent the return of , all Belgian and other foreign military and political advisers ; ; 
ordered an investigation of Lumumba's death ; ; 
urged the reconvention of the Congolese Parliament and the reorganization of the army . 
The presidency : talking and listening 
Though President John F. Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign policy last week . 
High up on the President's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte . 
On this issue , the President received a detailed report from his U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio . 
Ideally , the President would like the French to agree on a `` status quo ante '' on Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base . 
To continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend . 
The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government , Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham , who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. support . 
The conversation apparently convinced Mr. Kennedy that the positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable . 
Through Ladgham , Mr. Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba ; ; 
and one U.S. official said : `` The key question now is which side picks up the phone first '' . 
On the Latin American front , the President held talks with Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon before sending him to Uruguay and the Inter-American Economic and Social Council ( which the President himself had originally hoped to attend ) . 
Main purpose of the meeting : To discuss President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress . 
And that was not all . 
In conferences with Nationalist China's dapper , diminutive Vice President Chen Cheng , Mr. Kennedy assured Chiang Kai-shek's emissary that the U.S. is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of Red China to the United Nations . 
Chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of Outer Mongolia ; ; 
however the President , who would like to woo the former Chinese province away from both Peking and Moscow , would promise Chen nothing more than an abstention by the U.S. if Outer Mongolia's admission comes to a vote . 
The President also conferred with emissaries from Guatemala and Nepal who are seeking more foreign aid . 
To Africa , he sent his most trusted adviser , his brother , Attorney General Robert Kennedy , on a good-will mission to the Ivory Coast . 
All week long the President clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs ; ; 
in effect , he was practicing what he preached in his Berlin message two weeks ago when he declared : `` We shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk , and listen , with reason '' . 
Crime : ' skyjacked ' 
From International Airport in Los Angeles to International Airport in Houston , as the great four-jet Boeing 707 flies , is a routine five hours and 25 minutes , including stopovers at Phoenix , El Paso , and San Antonio . 
When Continental Airlines night-coach Flight 54 took off at 11:30 one night last week , there was no reason to think it would take any longer . 
The plane put down on schedule at 1:35 a.m. in Phoenix . 
Thirty-one minutes later , when it took off for El Paso , hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard . 
At 3:57 a.m. , with the plane about twenty minutes out of El Paso , passenger Robert Berry , a San Antonio advertising man , glanced up and saw the man and boy , accompanied by a stewardess , walking up the aisle toward the cockpit . 
`` The man was bent over with his hand on his stomach '' , Berry said . 
`` I figured he was sick '' . 
John Salvador , a farmer from Palm Desert , Calif. , was sitting up front and could see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit . 
`` The kid had a automatic , like they issue in the Army '' , he said . 
`` The other fellow had a '' . 
Salvador saw the youth hold his against the head of stewardess Lois Carnegey ; ; 
the man put his at the head of Capt. Byron D. Rickards . 
To Rickards , a 52-year-old veteran 30 years in the air , it was an old story : His plane was being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930 , when Peruvian rebels made him land a Ford tri-motor at Arequipa . 
But last week's pirates , like the Cuban-American who recently hijacked an Eastern Airlines Electra ( Newsweek , Aug. 7 ) , wanted to go to Havana . 
Stalling : 
`` Tell your company there are four of us here with guns '' , the elder man told Rickards . 
The pilot radioed El Paso International Airport with just that message . 
But , he told the `` skyjackers '' , the 707 didn't carry enough fuel to reach Havana ; ; 
they would have to refuel at El Paso . 
Most passengers didn't know what had happened until they got on the ground . 
Jerry McCauley of Sacramento , Calif. , one of some twenty Air Force recruits on board , awoke from a nap in confusion . 
`` The old man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to Cuba '' , McCauley said , `` and like a nut I raised my hand . 
I thought he was the Air Force recruiter '' . 
What the man wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages , along with the crew . 
They chose four : Jack Casey , who works for Continental Airlines in Houston ; ; 
Fred Mullen from Mercer Island , Wash. ; ; 
Pfc. Truman Cleveland of St. Augustine . 
Fla. , and Leonard Gilman , a former college boxer and veteran of the U.S. Immigration Service Border Patrol . 
Everybody else was allowed to file off the plane after it touched down at El Paso at 4:18 a.m. . 
They found a large welcoming group -- El Paso policemen , Border Patrol , sheriff's deputies , and FBI men , who surged around the plane with rifles and submachine guns . 
Other FBI men , talking with the pilot from the tower , conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to Havana . 
The ground crew , which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty minutes , took fully three hours . 
Still more time was consumed while the pilot , at the radioed suggestion of Continental president Robert Six , tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the Boeing jet for a propeller-driven Douglas Aj . 
Actually , the officers on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of an airplane ; ; 
they had orders to that effect straight from President Kennedy , who thought at first , as did most others , that it was four followers of Cuba's Fidel Castro who had taken over the 707 . 
Mr. Kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane , kept in touch throughout by telephone . 
At one time , while still under the impression that he was dealing with a Cuban plot , the President talked about invoking a total embargo on trade with Cuba . 
As the morning wore on and a blazing West Texas sun wiped the shadows off the Franklin Mountains , police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment . 
From the luggage , they learned that the two air pirates , far from being Cubans , were native Americans , subsequently identified as Leon Bearden , 50-year-old ex-convict from Coolidge , Ariz. , and his son , Cody , 16 , a high-school junior . 
Tension 
The heat and strain began to tell on the Beardens . 
The father , by accident or perhaps to show , as he said , `` we mean business '' , took the and fired a slug between the legs of Second Officer Norman Simmons . 
At 7:30 a.m. , more than three hours after landing , the Beardens gave an ultimatum : 
Take off or see the hostages killed . 
The tower cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a.m. , and Captain Rickards began taxiing toward the runway . 
Several police cars , loaded with armed officers , raced alongside , blazing away at the tires of the big jet . 
The slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines ; ; 
the plane slowed to a halt . 
Ambulances , baggage trucks , and cars surrounded it . 
The day wore on . 
At 12:50 p.m. a ramp was rolled up to the plane . 
A few minutes later , FBI agent Francis Crosby , talking fast , eased up the ramp to the plane , unarmed . 
While Crosby distracted the Beardens , stewardesses Carnegey and Toni Besset dropped out of a rear door . 
So did hostages Casey , Cleveland , and Mullen . 
That left only the four crew members , Crosby , and Border Patrolman Gilman , all unarmed , with the Beardens . 
The elder Bearden had one pistol in his hand , the other in a hip pocket . 
Gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance . 
He caught officer Simmons' eye , nodded toward young Bearden , and -- `` I swung my right as hard as I could . 
Simmons and Crosby jumped the boy and it was all over '' . 
Frog-marched off the airplane at 1:48 p.m. , the Beardens were held in bail of $100,000 each on charges of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines . 
( Bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to Castro , and live high in Cuba . 
) Back home in Coolidge , Ariz. , his 36-year-old wife , Mary , said : `` I thought they were going to Phoenix to look for jobs '' . 
Congress : more muscle 
Taking precedence over all other legislation on Capitol Hill last week was the military strength of the nation . 
The Senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass -- 85 to 0 -- the largest peacetime defense budget in U.S. history . 
With the money all but in hand , however , the Administration indicated that , instead of the 225,000 more men in uniform that President Kennedy had requested , the armed forces would be increased by only 160,000 . 
The `` hold-back '' , as Pentagon mutterers labeled it , apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and , thus , the new funds spent prudently . 
In all , the Senate signed a check for $46.7 billion , which not only included the extra $3.5 billion requested the week before by President Kennedy , but tacked on $754 million more than the President had asked for . 
( The Senate , on its own , decided to provide additional B-52 and other long-range bombers for the Strategic Air Command . 
) The House , which had passed its smaller appropriation before the President's urgent call for more , was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order . 
In other areas , Congressional action last week included : 
The Senate ( by voice vote ) and the House ( by 224-170 ) passed and sent to the White House the compromise farm bill which the President is expected to sign , not too unhappily . 
The Senate also voted $5.2 billion to finance the government's health , welfare , and labor activities . 
Debate on the all-important foreign-aid bill , with its controversial long-range proposals , had just begun on the Senate floor at the weekend . 
White House legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact . 
Food : stew a la Mulligatawny 
Most members of the U.S. Senate , because they are human , like to eat as high on the hog as they can . 
But , because they are politicians , they like to talk as poor-mouth as the lowliest voter . 
As a result , ever since 1851 when the Senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the Capitol Building , the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food -- even while they opposed every move that might improve it . 
Over the years , enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of Maine and Idaho potatoes , the menu has pursued its drab all-American course . 
Individual senators , with an eye to the voters back home , occasionally introduced smelts from Michigan , soft-shell crabs from Maryland , oysters from Washington , grapefruit from Florida . 
But plain old bean soup , served daily since the turn of the century ( at the insistence of the late Sen. Fred Dubois of Idaho ) , made clear to the citizenry that the Senate's stomach was in the right place . 
In a daring stroke , the Senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a $10,000-per-year French-born maitre d'hotel . 
Holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes . 
Long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward . 
Higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues . 
Result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative . 
Things are looking up these days for many of the State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds . 
Traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing . 
That added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates . 
As a result of the new outlook for turnpikes , investors who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments . 
Another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds . 
Other tax-exempt bonds of State and local governments hit a price peak on February 21 , according to Standard & Poor's average . 
On balance , prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then . 
However , in the same three-month period , toll-road bonds , as a group , have bucked this trend . 
On these bonds , price rises since February 21 easily outnumber price declines . 
Tax-free returns . 
Investors , however , still see an element of more-than-ordinary risk in the toll-road bonds . 
You find the evidence of that in the chart on this page . 
Many of the toll-road bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent , or very close to that . 
And this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to , or beyond , the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds . 
That 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds . 
It's not much more , in fact , than the return that is offered on U. S. Treasury bonds . 
For investors whose income is taxed at high rates , though , a tax-free yield of 4 per cent is high . 
It is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than $16,000 of income to be taxed , or for a married couple with more than $32,000 of taxed income . 
Swelling traffic . 
A new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12-month period -- ending in February or March -- shows what is happening . 
The report is based on a survey by Blyth & Company , investment bankers . 
Nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period . 
And there is the bright note : The gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession . 
Many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter . 
Indication : The long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward . 
Look , for example , at the Ohio Turnpike . 
Traffic on that road slumped sharply in January and February , as compared with those same months in 1960 . 
Then March brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues -- after operating costs . 
As a result , the road's net revenues in the 12 months ending March 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds . 
That was up from 173 per cent in the preceding 12 months . 
That same pattern of earnings shows up on the Massachusetts Turnpike . 
Operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961 , but up for the 12 months ending in March . 
Costs were held down , despite a bitter winter . 
For the year , the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs , against 121 per cent in the preceding period . 
The road's engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into Boston . 
Slow successes . 
Some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do . 
The 187-mile Illinois State Toll Highway , for example , was not opened over its entire length until December , 1958 . 
In the 12 months ended in February , 1960 , the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load -- with the remainder paid out of initial reserves . 
In the 12 months ended in February , 1961 , this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest . 
That improvement is continuing . 
In the first two months of 1961 , earnings of the Illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960 . 
Success , for many turnpikes , has come hard . 
Traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy estimates . 
In these cases , the turnpike managements have had to turn to toll-rate increases , or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways . 
Many rate increases already have been put into effect . 
Higher tolls are planned for July 1 , 1961 , on the Richmond-Petersburg , Va. , Turnpike , and proposals for increased tolls on the Texas Turnpike are under study . 
Easier access . 
Progress is being made , too , in improving motorists' access to many turnpikes . 
The Kansas Turnpike offers an illustration . 
Net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended Feb. 28 , 1961 . 
Further improvements in earnings of the Kansas Turnpike are expected late in 1961 , with the opening of a new bypass at Wichita , and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both Kansas City , Kans. , and Kansas City , Mo. . 
Meanwhile , there appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years . 
For some roads , troubles . 
Investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals . 
Traffic and revenues on the Chicago Skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike . 
If nothing is done , the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962 . 
West Virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months , and , despite recent improvement in revenues , holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same . 
These , however , are exceptions . 
The typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement . 
It's going to take time for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in full . 
Already , however , several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins . 
Many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even point . 
A top American official , after a look at Europe's factories , thinks the U.S. is in a `` very serious situation '' competitively . 
Commerce Secretary Luther Hodges , accompanied by a member of our staff , on May 10 toured plants of two of Italy's biggest companies -- Fiat , the auto producer , and Olivetti , maker of typewriters and calculating machines . 
Our staff man cabled from Turin as follows -- 
`` Follow Secretary Hodges through the Fiat plant , and you learn this : 
`` One , modern equipment -- much of it supplied under the Marshall Plan -- enables Fiat to turn out 2,100 cars a day . 
About half of these are exported . 
`` Two , wage costs are a fraction of the U.S. costs . 
A skilled worker on the assembly line , for example , earns $37 a week . 
`` Three , labor troubles are infrequent . 
Fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years . 
`` Said Secretary Hodges : ' It's a tough combination for the U.S. to face . 
`` Olivetti had a special interest for Hodges . 
Olivetti took over Underwood , the U.S. typewriter maker , in late 1959 . 
Within a year , without reducing wages , Underwood's production costs were cut one third , prices were slashed . 
The result has been that exports of Underwood products have doubled . 
`` The Olivetti plant near Turin has modern layout , modern machinery . 
The firm is design-conscious , sales-conscious , advertising-conscious . 
`` Hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the U.S. . 
The inflow of foreign capital would help the U.S. balance of payments . 
`` Hodges predicted : ' I think we will see more foreign firms coming to the U.S. . 
There are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas ' '' . 
Foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that Washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports . 
The recently unveiled Kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for American businessmen in many lines . 
Important aspects of the Kennedy textile plans are these : 
An international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting countries will be called shortly by President Kennedy . 
Chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting . 
The U.S. will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed countries over the years . 
Point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first , need encouragement to get on their feet . 
If they have trouble exporting , international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would . 
Idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible . 
At the same time , another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports -- especially dumping of specific products -- to high-wage textile-producing countries . 
Japan , since 1957 , has been `` voluntarily '' curbing exports of textiles to the U.S. . 
Hong Kong , India and Pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to Britain for several years under the `` Lancashire Pact '' . 
None of these countries is happy with these arrangements . 
The Japanese want to increase exports to the U.S. While they have been curbing shipments , they have watched Hong Kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big U.S. market . 
Hong Kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to Britain , while Spanish and Portuguese textiles pour into British market unrestrictedly . 
The Indians and Pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the British market for similar reasons . 
The Kennedy hope is that , at the conference or through bilateral talks , the low-wage textile-producing countries in Asia and Europe will see that `` dumping '' practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas . 
Gradual , controlled expansion of the world's textile trade is what President Kennedy wants . 
This may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products . 
It's an important clue to Washington thinking . 
Note , too , that the Kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the U.S. textile industry . 
`` Get competitive or get out '' . 
In veiled terms , that's what the Kennedy Administration is saying to the American textile industry . 
The Government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines , where modernization doesn't seem feasible . 
Special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed . 
Government research will look into new products and methods . 
Import quotas aren't ruled out where the national interest is involved . 
But the Kennedy Administration doesn't favor import quotas . 
Rather , they are impressed with the British Government's success in forcing -- and helping -- the British textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products . 
What's happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from low-wage countries . 
Among the highest-paid workers in the world are U.S. coal miners . 
Yet U.S. coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers' mouths water . 
Steel Company of Wales , a British steelmaker , wants to bring in Virginia coal , cut down on its takings of Welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively -- especially in foreign markets . 
Virginia coal , delivered by ship in Wales , will be about $2.80 a ton cheaper than Welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines . 
U.S. coal is cheap , despite high wages , because of widespread mechanization of mines , wide coal seams , attactive rates on ocean freight . 
Many of the coal seams in the nationalized British mines are twisting , narrow and very deep . 
Productivity of U.S. miners is twice that of the British . 
Welsh coal miners , Communist-led , are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in American coal . 
They threaten to strike . 
The British Government will have to decide whether to let U.S. coal in . 
The British coal industry is unprofitable , has large coal stocks it can't sell . 
Every library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically , `` I'm sorry , but we don't have that book . 
There wouldn't be much demand for it , I'm afraid '' . 
Behind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest . 
What to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles ? ? 
What to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ? ? 
Most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate . 
A startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually , which includes the librarian's salary , and not even the New York Public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world's richest city . 
The plight of a small community library is proportionately worse . 
Confronted with this situation , most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have , or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds . 
In some parts of the country , however , a co-operative movement has begun to grow , under the wing of state governments , whereby , with the financial help of the state , libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basis . 
New York State has what is probably the most advanced of these co-operative systems , so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow . 
Because it is so large a state , with marked contrasts in population density , the organization of the New York co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works . 
At one extreme are the systems of upper New York State , where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large , sparsely populated area . 
At the other are organizations like the newly formed Nassau Library System , in a high-density area , with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve . 
Both these types , and those in between , are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at Albany as early as 1950 , with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state . 
It was a step in the right direction , but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of today . 
Under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts . 
An earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not , as they saw fit . 
Some library boards are wary of the plan . 
A large , well-stocked library , surrounded in a county by smaller ones , may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great . 
A small library may cherish its independence and established ways , and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board . 
Within a system , however , the autonomy of each member library is preserved . 
The local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program , facilities , and services , but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system . 
All services are given without cost to members . 
So obvious are these advantages that nearly 95 per cent of the population of New York State now has access to a system , and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day , not too distant , when all the libraries in the state will belong to a co-op . 
To set up a co-operative library system , the law requires a central book collection of 100,000 nonfiction volumes as the nucleus , and the system is organized around it . 
The collection may be in an existing library , or it may be built up in a central collection . 
Each system develops differently , according to the area it serves , but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency . 
The basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served , and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita , if a library spends a certain number of dollars . 
In Nassau County , for example , the heavily settled Long Island suburb of New York City , the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons , a figure that has doubled since 1950 . 
This system , by virtue of its variety and size , offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation . 
The Nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service , what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge , and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area . 
The need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries , adequate to satisfy everyday needs , could afford . 
Nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its Hempstead headquarters , which will reach its goal of 100,000 volumes by 1965 . 
The major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building , and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers . 
Basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection , but there is also specialization in science and technology , an indicated weakness in local libraries . 
On microfilm , headquarters also has a file of the New York Times from its founding in 1851 to the present day , as well as bound volumes of important periodicals . 
The entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans . 
Headquarters gets about 100 requests every day . 
It is connected by teletype with the State Library in Albany , which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide . 
The books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries . 
Each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area , which headquarters could then build upon . 
East Meadow has philosophy , psychology , and religion ; ; 
Freeport houses social science , pure science , and language ; ; 
history , biography , and education are centered in Hempstead ; ; 
Levittown has applied science , business , and literature ; ; 
while Hewlett-Woodmere is the repository of art , music , and foreign languages . 
The reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant , and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service . 
This kind of cooperation is not wholly new , of course . 
Public libraries in Nassau County have been lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century , but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis . 
Local libraries find , too , that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system , and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library . 
The system passes on these savings to its members . 
Further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing . 
Books are not the only resource of the system . 
Schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary , art , and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs , and to organizations in member communities . 
The most recent film catalogue , available at each library , lists 110 titles presently in the collection , any of which may be borrowed without charge . 
This catalogue lists separately films suitable for children , young adults , or adults , although some classics cut across age groups , such as `` Nanook Of The North '' , `` The Emperor's Nightingale '' , and `` The Red Balloon '' . 
Workshops are conducted by the system's audio-visual consultant for the staffs of member libraries , teaching them the effective use of film as a library service . 
The system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together ; ; 
consequently an experienced children's librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned library activities , cooperating with the children's librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences , workshops , and frequent visits . 
Headquarters has also set up a central juvenile book-review and book-selection center , to provide better methods of purchasing and selection . 
Sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters , where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups . 
Story hours , pre-school programs , activities with community agencies , and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the children's consultant . 
Headquarters of the Nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days , threatening to expand beyond its boundaries . 
In addition to the interlibrary loan service and the children's program , headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county ; ; 
it prepares cooperative displays ( posters , booklists , brochures , and other promotional material ) for use in member libraries ; ; 
it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used ; ; 
and it publishes Sum And Substance , a monthly newsletter , which reports the system's activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries . 
The system itself is governed by a board of trustees , geographically representing its membership . 
In Nassau , as in other systems , the long-range objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools , and on adult education in general . 
Librarians , a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication , can begin to see results today . 
Library use is multiplying daily , and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned Americans , the teen-agers . 
To them especially the librarians , with the help of co-ops , hope they will never have to say , `` I'm sorry , we don't have that book '' . 
Today , more than ever before , the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned . 
The great advances made in recent years in Communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the Western world . 
The need for lifetime reading is apparent . 
Education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives , for it is only through knowledge that we , as a nation , can cope with the dangers that threaten our society . 
The desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life . 
We cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read ; ; 
if we are not discriminating in our reading ; ; 
if we do not know how to use what we do read . 
We must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age , as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word . 
A fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries . 
Although progress has been made in America's system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed America . 
The problem grows in intensity each year as man's knowledge , and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word , continue to expand . 
The inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition . 
There are , for example , approximately 25,000,000 people in this country with no public library service and about 50,000,000 with inadequate service . 
In college libraries , 57 per cent of the total number of books are owned by 124 of 1,509 institutions surveyed last year by the U.S. Office of Education . 
And over 66 per cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library at all . 
In every aspect of service -- to the public , to children in schools , to colleges and universities -- the library of today is failing to render vitally needed services . 
Only public understanding and support can provide that service . 
This is one of the main reasons for National Library Week , April 16-22 , and for its theme : `` For a richer , fuller life , read '' ! !
